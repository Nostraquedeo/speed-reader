# Speed Reader — RSVP demo

Minimal web demo of an RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) reader that shows one word at a time centered on the screen with the ORP (optimal recognition point) letter highlighted in red.

Features:
- Paste text or upload a plain `.txt` file
- Start / Stop controls and spacebar shortcut
- WPM speed control and font-size slider
- Simple ORP heuristic and centering logic

Run locally:
1. Clone the repo and open `index.html` in a browser:
   - git clone git@github.com:Nostraquedeo/speed-reader.git
   - open index.html (or serve with a static server)

Notes:
- This is a minimal demo. If you'd like, I can convert it to a React component, add progress/profiles, or enable GitHub Pages hosting.
